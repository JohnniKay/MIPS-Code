# MIPS Code Lab Assignments
This repository contains a collection of MIPS assembly language lab assignments completed during my computer science studies. These assignments demonstrate my proficiency in low-level programming concepts, specifically with the MIPS architecture. Each lab explores different aspects of assembly programming, from basic operations to more complex algorithms, and showcases my understanding of the fundamentals of systems programming.

## Technologies Used:
**MIPS Assembly Language:** The core language used for all assignments.

**MARS MIPS Simulator:** Used for running and debugging MIPS assembly code.

**Visual Studio Code:** IDE for writing and editing code.

## Labs:
The repository includes the following assignments:

Lab 2: Demonstrates basic operations in MIPS assembly, focusing on data handling, arithmetic operations, and system calls to interact with the console. The code is split into three problems, each showcasing different MIPS programming concepts.

Lab 3: Shows how to collect user input, store the data in memory, perform arithmetic operations on each element, and print the results. Introduces modifying data based on a key and outputting the modified data to the console.

Lab 4: Handles user input and calculates the length of a string. The program prompts the user for a string, calculates its length using a custom function, and prints the result.

Lab 5: Implements a simple "magic number" game where the program prompts the user to input a number, and the program attempts to "read their mind" by performing mathematical operations and confirming the result.

Lab 6: Focuses on arithmetic operations involving both whole numbers and decimals. The program processes the input to extract both parts, converts the whole number to binary, adds both parts together, and outputs the results in various formats.

Lab 7: Involves a program that takes two sets of coordinates as input, applies translation values, and computes the translated coordinates. The program prints both the original and translated coordinates to the console.

Lab 8: Demonstrates file handling by reading and displaying the contents of a bitmap file (pillars.bmp). The program extracts and displays data from the file, including reading the bitmap header.

## Installation:
To view or modify the code on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/JohnniKay/MIPS-Code.git
Open and Edit Files: Open the .asm files with a text editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code or MARS MIPS Simulator).

## Running the Code:
For running the MIPS code, you will need the MARS MIPS Simulator or any similar tool that can execute MIPS assembly code.

**1.** Download and install MARS if you havenâ€™t already.

**2.** Load the .asm files into the simulator and run the code.

## Notes:
These are lab exercises and are not standalone programs.

The assignments focus on various aspects of MIPS assembly, such as arithmetic, loops, branching, string manipulation, file handling, and more.

Each lab builds on concepts from previous labs, showcasing the progression of skills learned.

Some of the assignments are focused on basic arithmetic, loops, and branching, while others handle more advanced data manipulation and function calls.
